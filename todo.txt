bugs:
  graveyard not displaying runes discarded when moving to new level
  button placement
  new game button remains active after being CLICKED

level display

save stuff:
  event on score change
  event on level update
  event on place rune - update board state save
    - format?
  event on discard rune - engine level

  new game should remove curent game save info: score, level, graveyard state, board state

  ** on initialize, check level def version vs. saved version; delete in compatible data

  need to capture
  rune cell depth index
  runetile, if Any

  probbaly need to modify grave renderer to accept rune tiles, not just elements


restore stuff:


placement indicator
hide new game button between levels
rune box for mobile

new game button

end game
  prevent click event - probably done

transfer rune directly from float to foregroundLayer
-- but will not be dirty - how to fix?

engine level character renderer
 ``` pix renderer?

replace game engine event notification system with mixin from common
