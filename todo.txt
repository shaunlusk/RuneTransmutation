bugs:
  button placement
  new game button remains active after being CLICKED

level display

save stuff:
  ** on initialize, check level def version vs. saved version; delete in compatible data


placement indicator
hide new game button between levels
rune box for mobile

persist current rune - prevent refresh cheating

end game
  prevent click event - probably done

transfer rune directly from float to foregroundLayer
-- but will not be dirty - how to fix?

engine level character renderer
 ``` pix renderer?

replace game engine event notification system with mixin from common
